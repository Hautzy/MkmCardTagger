# MkmCardTagger

MkmCardTagger is a price tagging software which helps magic players to make better deals onÂ [www.cardmarket.com](https://www.cardmarket.com/de/Magic).

The user can tag certain cards and add them to his/her watchlist to keep track of the price development. Furthermore the user can specify which price trends trigger card price alerts. Alerts can be sent via email, telegram, whatsapp and sms to inform the user that his/her tagged card's price follows a certain trend.

Additionally the user can build his/her own magic deck to track the deck price and the deck prices of the most famous decks currently played.

(Perhaps the system will be developed even further to add price comparision of different magic trading websites.)
